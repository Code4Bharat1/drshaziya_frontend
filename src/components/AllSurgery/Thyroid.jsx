      `Thyroid surgery, or thyroidectomy, involves removing all or part of the thyroid gland to treat conditions like nodules, goitre, hyperthyroidism, or thyroid cancer. Depending on the condition, either a total or partial thyroidectomy is performed. The surgery can be done through a traditional large incision or using minimally invasive and laser techniques. These advanced methods help ensure precision and quicker recovery.`,

    text: [
      `Doctors recommend thyroid surgery for various reasons, with suspicious nodules being a common indication due to potential cancer risk. It is also performed to treat confirmed thyroid cancer and prevent its spread. Large goiters causing breathing or swallowing issues may need removal. Surgery is considered for hyperthyroidism when medications fail or arenâ€™t suitable. The decision depends on individual patient needs and medical evaluation.`,
