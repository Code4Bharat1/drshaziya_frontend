    text: [
      "A hernia occurs when an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall. It can develop in various parts of the body, most commonly in the abdomen, groin, upper thigh, and belly button area. A bulge or lump may be noticeable, especially when coughing, bending over, or lifting heavy objects. Hernias can be painful and may require surgical treatment to repair the weak spot and prevent complications."

    title: "When Do Doctors Recommend Hernia Surgery?",
    text: [
      "Doctors usually recommend hernia surgery if the hernia is painful, growing, or causing complications. Hernia surgery helps prevent the risk of strangulation â€” a serious condition where the blood supply to the trapped tissue is cut off. Surgery is also advised when lifestyle changes or medications cannot alleviate the symptoms. Laparoscopic hernia repair is a common minimally invasive method involving smaller incisions, less pain, and a quicker recovery compared to open surgery."
